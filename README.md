BUGS:
There's a bug when the overwhelmed bot is not sending the audio. Please do multiple times to generate this voice.<br/>
A bug whenever is there a some SAPI5 voice not generating correctly. You have to repeat the voice generation to work.<br/>
Using quotes (") will also end the voice. As the alternative sentence "\" will cut it off to the next sentence.<br/>
Using other punctuation with Unicode control may cause the bot to fail generating it.<br/>
